# 🚨 ClickJacking Vulnerability Scanner 🚨
- This tool automates the detection of ClickJacking vulnerabilities by scanning a list of targets provided in a file.
- For each vulnerable target found, it generates an Exploit Proof of Concept (PoC) in the form of an HTML file.

## What is ClickJacking? 🤔
- ClickJacking (also known as User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, or UI redressing) is a malicious technique where a web user is tricked into clicking on something different from what they perceive, potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while interacting with seemingly harmless web pages.
- A server that doesn’t return an `X-Frame-Options header` is vulnerable to ClickJacking attacks. The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header is used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page within a `<frame> or <iframe>`.
- Websites can prevent ClickJacking attacks by using the `X-Frame-Options` header to ensure their content isn’t embedded in other sites.
