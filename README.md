# ClickJackPoc

- This tool will help you automate finding Clickjacking Vulnerability by just passing a file containing list of Targets .

## What is Clickjacking ?

- Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages.
- The server didn't return an X-Frame-Options header which means that this website could be at risk of a clickjacking attack. The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame> or <iframe>. 
- Sites can use "X-Frame-Options" in the headers to avoid clickjacking attacks by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.
